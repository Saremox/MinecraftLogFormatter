MinecraftLogFormatter
=====================

A simple cli created to compile Minecraft-serverlogs into HTML-files.

The intended functionality is the input of a file, chosen via parameters, parse its
lines, convert special charakters and add color-tags for "warning", "info" and so on.
Then HTML-files containing up to 100 lines each will be written, these should also
contain links to the next and previous site.
